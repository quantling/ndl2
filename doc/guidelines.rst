Code Guidelines
===============

General
=======
* do not use tabs, use spaces (except for tab seperated data files)


Testing
=======
In ``R`` we use the ``testthat`` package and in ``C++`` we use ``CATCH``.
``CATCH`` sources are included, but ``testthat`` needs to be installed within
``R``.


C++
===
* use C++11
* use vectors
* use camelCase for variable and class naming


R-Script
========
* use camelCase for variable and class naming
