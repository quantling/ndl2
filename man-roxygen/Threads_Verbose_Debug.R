#' @param numThreads The number of thread to use (by default it uses the value
#'   set in the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, which is also what many
#'   other R functions use to determine the number of threads to use.)
#' @param verbose Whether to print status updates and other information during
#'   processing.
#' @param debug Whether debugging output is shown (implies \code{verbose}).
